> I’ve reviewed the folder structure you proposed — looks good.  
  For now, keep all business content inline inside JSX components (no /content folder).  
  Please update the folder structure and Business Section → Component Mapping table accordingly, and send me the revised version for review before coding.

⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Update folder structure to remove /content folder and keep business content inline
     ☐ Revise Business Section to Component Mapping table

⏺ 1. Revised Folder Structure Tree

⏺ 3. Updated Compliance Justification

  Simplified Architecture Benefits

  - Faster Development: Business content directly in components eliminates import complexity
  - Single Source: Each component owns its business narrative, reducing cross-file dependencies
  - Line Limit Compliance: Inline content forces concise, focused messaging within ≤400 line limits
  - Self-Contained: Components remain modular and reusable even with embedded business content

  Audit Trail Maintained

  - Component-Level Traceability: Business requirements directly mapped to specific JSX components
  - Version Control: All business content changes tracked through component file history
  - Clear Ownership: Each business section has designated component maintainer

  This revised structure maintains scalability while simplifying the development workflow by keeping business content directly within the responsible components.
